        <h1>Rules and Settings</h1>
        <p>
          Among Us is a part adventure game, part puzzler, and part murder
          mystery sim. The basic rules are incredibly straightforward; if you’re
          a crewmate
        </p>
        <img src="/images/image 3.png" />
        <p>complete all your tasks while discovering who the Impostor is.</p>
        <p>If you’re the Impostor</p>
        <img src="/images/image 4.png" />
        <p>kill everyone without being discovered.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="real rule">
        <p>
          Aside from that, the only real rule in Among Us is that you shouldn’t
          talk outside of meetings if you’re playing IRL or in a group chat, and
          that ghosts (killed crewmates) shouldn’t talk at all.

        <p>
          Each map comes with recommended settings, but these can be tweaked by
          the host.

          Here's a quick rundown of the settings yo might want to change game to
          game:
        </p>
        <p>
          *Impostors: This refers to the amount of Impostors in play. The limit
          refers to the lowest number of Impostors allowed (if your lobby isn’t
          full, the game can decide to have fewer Impostors).
        </p>
        <p>
          *Confirm Ejects: With this on, it will tell you if the person you just
          ejected was an Impostor or not. With it off, it won't.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Emergency Meetings: This is the amount of emergency meetings a player
          can call from the center of the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Emergency Cooldown: This is the amount of time you need to wait in
          between emergency meetings. When playing online, having a long cool
          down stops it being abused.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Discussion Time: How long in seconds you can discuss Impostors in
          meetings before you vote.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Voting Time: How long in seconds you have to vote. Discussions can
          continue during this time. Shorter time limits make the game more
          intense, longer limits make them more methodical.
        </p>
        <p>*Player Speed: How fast the players move around the ship</p>
        <p>*Crewmate Vision: How far the crewmates can see around the ship.</p>
        <p>
          *Impostor Vision: How far the Impostor can see around the ship.
          Impostors typically get better vision to make their job easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Kill Cooldown: How long the Impostor must wait in between kills. The
          more Impostors, the longer it should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Kill Distance: How close (short, normal, or long) the Impostor must
          be to kill someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Visual Tasks: A few tasks, such as scanning in the MedBay, are
          visual, as in other players can see you. If you are seen doing a
          visual task, that’s proof that you’re not the Impostor.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Long Tasks: These tasks take the longest as the name implies and
          involve visiting multiple rooms to complete them.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Common Tasks: These are the most basic tasks in the game, and take an
          average time to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Short Tasks: These tasks are very short and can be completed quickly,
          in a single location.
